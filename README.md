# Dice Roller

As the name implies, this is a very simple RPG dice roller app using vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript. It's a bit of an exercise in "keeping things simple", aka not pulling out Angular/React/whatever just to implement some basic functionality.

The code isn't super clean, could use some refactoring to make all of its intent clearer, but it's certainly small enough.

It's mainly targeting mobile screens, and probably needs some more work to make it look nice on desktop.

To run it, all you need to do is download the repo and open up index.html. No fancy tooling needed, just a browser.
